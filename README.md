# Etch-A-Sketch
![](sketch.gif)

## Description

This one was one of the most fun projects I built so far. Basically what this is a whiteboard where users can draw pixel art and even change their desired pixel size.
This project is also part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Lessons Learned

- Learned how to change CSS Grid values with Javascript, so the user can change the pixel size.
- Learned how to use the repeat() function on CSS Grid.

## Try it Yourself!
